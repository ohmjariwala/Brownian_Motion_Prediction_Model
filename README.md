# Brownian_Motion_Prediction_Model

This model returns the expected stock price of a stock using the Geometric Brownian Motion conditions and model. Additionally, the model provides the maximum and minimum stock prices at a given time from the Monte Carlo simulations. This model would be best suited for short term projections and could be built upon to give more a more accurate long term stock price projection.
